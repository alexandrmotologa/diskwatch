//! Process attribution for Hot Files.
//!
//! Neither of the event sources behind the Hot Files tab carries a pid:
//! inotify doesn't report one at all, and FSEvents only would through the
//! Endpoint Security framework, which is entitlement-gated. So the answer
//! to "which process is writing this file" has to be assembled from two
//! other readings, both of them unprivileged:
//!
//! - **Per-process byte rates**, from `sysinfo`, which reads
//!   `/proc/<pid>/io` on Linux and `proc_pidinfo` on macOS. This says who
//!   is doing IO, in bytes, but not to which path.
//! - **Open file descriptors**, from `/proc/<pid>/fd` on Linux and
//!   `PROC_PIDLISTFDS` on macOS. This says who is holding a path open,
//!   but not whether they are writing it.
//!
//! Crossing the two gives a per-path list of candidate processes ordered
//! by how much they are writing. That is an inference, not a measurement,
//! and it is wrong in two ways worth naming to the user rather than
//! papering over:
//!
//! 1. **It is sampled.** The fd scan runs every [`SCAN_INTERVAL`]. A
//!    process that opens a file, writes it and closes it between two scans
//!    never appears, even though its events do. Short-lived writers —
//!    compilers, `git`, package managers — are exactly the ones this
//!    misses.
//! 2. **Without root it is partial.** `/proc/<pid>/io` and `/proc/<pid>/fd`
//!    are readable only for your own uid. On a typical desktop that hides
//!    three quarters of the process table, and every daemon on a server.
//!    [`ProcessCollector::coverage`] reports how many were unreadable so
//!    the tab can say so instead of quietly showing you a fraction.
//!
//! Getting a real pid per event needs fanotify with `FAN_REPORT_PID`
//! (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) or eBPF (root) on Linux. Both are deliberate
//! non-goals here: diskwatch's whole premise is that it runs as you,
//! with no system dependencies.
